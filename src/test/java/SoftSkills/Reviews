My team uses "stock" cards to ensure that we always consider all diff types of tests.
When unit testing wasn't yet a habit, we wrote a unit test card for each story on the board.
Our "________" test card reminds the programmers to complete the job of integration testing and to make sure all of the parts of the code work together.

ANSWER: END-TO-END
====================

What do you need to look for in a tester?

1. experience writing black box and GUI test cases, designing tests to mitigate risks, and helping BAs define requirements

2. Experience writing simple SQL queries and insert/update statements and basic grasp of Oracle or another relational databse
===============================

1st question asked to Bota:
What makes testing successful?
Answer: Good metrics, a Defect Tracking System, knowledge base, traceability, customer support, co-location of team

===========================================

hy should we use DTS (Defect Tracking System?)
Answer: the bug database can be used as a knowledge base and it helps keep decisions and their background info
====================================================

Why should we NOT use a DTS?
Answer: If your team works better by documenting defects in executable tests and fixing them right away, do that instead.
 Sometimes, the team is small and works better by executing tests and fixing them right away
 =========================================================

 Discuss a test plan
 The power of planning is to identify possible issues and dependencies, to bring risks to the surface to be talked about
  and to be addressed, and to think about the big picture. The team needs to create a test plan document, but each project
  is different, so don't expect that the same solution will fit all. Sometimes our customers insist on a test plan document.
   A test plan might be part of a set of deliverables that also include items such as a requirements document and a design
    document. With very large requirements documents, using a traceability matrix is the only way a team knew it had good
    coverage.

==================================================================

Build/Operate/Check
setup/execute/validate is a simple way of doing it - be able to discuss this in a business context
====================================================================

What is an Artifact? What is Sprint and Product Backlog?
Answer: an Artifact is a product backlog and sprint backlog (in Agile Scrum methodology)
sprint backlog is the selected user stories
product backlog are all the user stories
=============================================================================

Product backlog is discussed in Sprint Grooming
Sprint backlog is discussed in Sprint Planning
=============================================================================

Code Design vs Test Design
Coding and testing are part of one process in agile development. Code design and test design are complementary and
interdependent. You can't write tests without a testable code design, and you can't write code without well-designed tests
 that clearly communicate requirements and are compatible with the system architecture. This is why we always consider
 coding and testing together. When we estimate stories we include time for BOTH coding and testing,
 and when we plan each iteration and story, we budget time to design both tests and code.
 ================================================================================================

 What is surefire?
 Tests in your test source directory can be any combination of the following:
 TestNG
 JUnit (3.8, 4.x or 5.x)
 POJO

 Which providers are available is controlled simply by the inclusion of the appropriate dependencies (i.e., junit:junit
  or junit:junit-dep for JUnit4, junit-jupiter-engine or junit-vintage-engine for JUnit5 and org.testng:testng 4.7+ for
   TestNG). Since this is required to compile the test classes anyway, no additional configuration is required.
 Note that any normal Surefire integration works identically no matter which providers are in use - so you can still produce
 a Cobertura report and a Surefire results report on your project web site for your TestNG tests, for example.
 The POJO provider above allows you to write tests that do not depend on either of JUnit and TestNG. It behaves in the same way,
  running all test* methods that are public in the class, but the API dependency is not required. To perform assertions
  , the JDK 1.4 assert keyword can be used. See Using POJO Tests for more information.
 All of the providers support the Surefire Plugin parameter configurations. However, there are additional options
 available if you are running TestNG tests (including if you are using TestNG to execute your JUnit tests,
  which occurs by default if both are present in Surefire).
 See Using TestNG for more information.

What is requirement traceability matrix?
EXCEL SHEET
Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) is a document that maps and traces user requirement with test cases.
 It captures all requirements proposed by the client and requirement traceability in a single document,
 delivered at the conclusion of the Software devlopement life cycle

 how does it relate to testers?
 how far did the testers get? keeps track of their progress
 here is an example https://strongqa.com/uploads/document/doc/52/traceability-matrix-template-01.xls
 =======================================================================================================================

Bug Life Cycle?
A Defect life cycle, also known as a Bug life cycle, is a cycle of a defect from which it goes through covering the
different states in its entire life. This starts as soon as any new defect
is found by a tester and comes to an end when a tester closes that defect assuring that it won't get reproduced again.

=============================================================================

Sans titre
Remember, a bug is not a bug at the beginning - it is a defect - first it gets assigned to a dev then he/she/they fixes
 it, and we retest it, then we reopen it

 dynamic black box testing - what is it?
  dynamic because the program is running-And, it’s black-box because you’re testing it without knowing exactly how it
  works— with blinders on. You’re entering inputs, receiving outputs, and checking the results. Another name commonly
  used for dynamic black-box testing is behavioral testing because you’re test- ing how the software actually behaves when
   it’s used.
 =========================================================
 Difference btw Static and Dynamic
 Static testing is more cost-effective than dynamic testing. ... Static testing is done in verification stage whereas
 dynamic testing is done in validation stage. In static testing code is being examined without being executed whereas
 In dynamic testing, code is being executed and tested without necessarily being examined.


 ===============================================
 WHAT IS THE DIFF BTW VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION?
 Verification: did we make the right system?
 Validation: did we make the system right?
 =========================================================================
 What is a technical writer?
 Technical writers, also called technical communicators, prepare instruction manuals, journal articles, and other
 supporting documents to communicate complex and technical information more easily. They also develop, gather, and
 disseminate technical information among customers, designers, and manufacturers.

 WHO ARE ARCHITECTS?
 ANSWER: Architects or system engineers are the technical experts on the product team.They’re usually very experienced
  and therefore are qualified to design the overall systems archi- tecture or design for the software. They work very
   closely with the programmers.

 ======================================================
 DESCRIBE NON-FUNCTIONAL TESTING
 NON-FUNCTIONAL TESTING
 Non-functional testing is defined as a type of Software testing to check non-functional aspects (performance, usability,
  reliability, etc) of a software application. It is designed to test the readiness of a system as per nonfunctional
   parameters which are never addressed by functional testing.
 =========================================================================
 WHAT IS GITHUB?
 Answer: It is a version control system - master has basic codes there


===========================================================
 Does a technical writer have a technical background? NO
 A technical writer doesn’t need to have experience in IT or even a degree in technical studies. For us, the most important
 thing was the knowledge of English, Microsoft office tools and flow diagrams.
 At first, we feared that such a person would feel lost in our company and project, but our doubts quickly disappeared.
 All thanks to an introduction plan, which I will present to you in the following paragraphs. It turned out that the
  key was the pacing – everything had to be dosed in order not to frighten the new employee with something he/she had
  never heard of. On their first day, I told our brand new technical writers that they’d work with databases.
  Their expressions were priceless. Now, after a short introduction, they work with the data from the database better than I do.

 ===============================================
 Why couldn’t your QA write all the documentation?
 WHY DON'T WE MAKE A TESTER WRITE ALL THE DOCUMENTATION? WHY USE A TECHNICAL WRITER WITH NO TECHNICAL BACKGROUND?
 During the first weeks of our project development, a QA did write all the software documentation. That QA is me.
  In the beginning, it was like a part-time job, but after the app had been tested, I was asked to document all the text inside.
   Then the client made a presentation in front of his/her business associates so that they could decide which part to change.
    The client also inputs all the changes in the appropriate excel columns for the devs to easily locate them. In time,
    I received more and more requests, and I gradually stopped testing the application, which had a negative impact on its final quality.
     We were wasting both QA time and the client’s money, which could instead be spent on 2 or 3 technical writers. For a similar price,
     we’d get the required documentation much faster.

 WHAT VERSION OF CUCUMBER ARE YOU USING?
 Safwan: make sure you say 4, b/c that's the only one that supports parallel
 ALSO: remember JUnit and Cucumber must be the same version

 What is a formal review?
 p.113 of 406
 Formal review has an established process where the review group must produce a written report summarizingthe results of
  the review and make that report available to the rest of the product develop- ment team. It’s imperative that others are
   told the results of the meeting—how many problems were found, where they were found, and so on.
  ================================================================================================================

 How do you resolve a Git Conflict?
 your local master is diff from remote master - so you should pull remote master - so since your two masters are diff -
  you cannot merge them - so you can do 'git stash' which will hide your changes then do a 'git pop' which will let them
  emerge. you can do 'git diff' which will show and label which one as 'head' and the other as 'master' - it's where your
  version head is at - it will show you these lines are diff- and then you have to PHYSICALLY delete which one you don't want
  ================================================================================================================

 'git reset' copy hashcode and do 'git reset hard' and it will redo everything to your code. let's say you do something
  stupid, you can just do 'git reset hard master' then that will wipe everything

  ================================================================================================================

 it will reset everything up until 'git push'
 'git reset' will revert back to the commits

 ================================================================================================================

 What is the difference btw SoftAssert and HardAssert?
 Soft Assert: Soft Assert collects errors during @Test. Soft Assert does not throw an exception when an assert fails and
 would continue with the next step after the assert statement. Hard Assert: Hard Assert throws an AssertExceptionimmediately
 when an assert statement fails and test suite continues with next @Test.

 How do you launch a browser?
 WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
 This is the java implementation of launching a browser in Selenium. Here, ‘WebDriver’ is an interface and we are creating
  a reference variable ‘driver’ of type WebDriver, instantiated using ‘FireFoxDriver’ class.
 For those who are not very proficient in Java, an interface is like a contract that classes implementing it must follow.
 An interface contains a set of variables and methods without anybody(no implementation, only method name, and signature).
  We cannot instantiate objects from interfaces. Hence, the below line of code is incorrect and throws a compile-time error
  saying “Cannot instantiate the type WebDriver”.

  ================================================================================================================

 How to handle a dropdown?
 Models a SELECT tag, providing helper methods to select and deselect options. Select is a class that is provided by Selenium
 to perform multiple operations on DropDown object and Multiple Select objects. This class can be found under the Selenium’s
 Support.UI.Select package. As Select is also an ordinary class, so it’s object is also created by a New keyword with
 regular class creation syntax.
 Select oSelect = new Select());
 The above code will generate compile-time error in Eclipse, as Select() is asking for constructor. Bring the cursor over
 Select(), Eclipse will populate a suggestion.
  ================================================================================================================

 Diff btw Element and WebElement?
 findElement is representing one
 findElements represents table or list
 ================================================================================================================
 How do you count how many checkboxes you have?
 I will check xpath, start input, put square bracket, put checkbox number

 Difference between Implicit Wait Vs Explicit Wait

 Implicit Wait time is applied to all the elements in the script
 Explicit Wait time is applied only to those elements which are intended by us
 In Implicit Wait, we need not specify "ExpectedConditions" on the element to be located
 In Explicit Wait, we need to specify "ExpectedConditions" on the element to be located
 It is recommended to use when the elements are located with the time frame specified in implicit wait
 It is recommended to use when the elements are taking long time to load and also for verifying the property of the
  element like(visibilityOfElementLocated, elementToBeClickable,elementToBeSelected)
